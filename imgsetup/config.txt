# run commands
# default: none
# runcmd contains a list of either lists or a string
# each item will be executed in order at rc.local like level with
# output to the console
# - if the item is a list, the items will be properly executed as if
#   passed to execve(3) (with the first arg as the command).
# - if the item is a string, it will be simply written to the file and
#   will be interpreted by 'sh'
#
# Note, that the list has to be proper yaml, so you have to escape
# any characters yaml would eat (':' can be problematic)
#runcmd:
# - [ ls, -l, / ]
# - [ sh, -xc, "echo $(date) ': hello world!'" ]
# - [ sh, -c, echo "=========hello world'=========" ]
# - ls -l /root
# - [ wget, "http://slashdot.org", -O, /tmp/index.html ]
